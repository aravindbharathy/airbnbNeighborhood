### Chicago Ward Shape Transitions


Example representing Chicago wards as a cartogram, boundaries, and bar chart with
path tween transitions. Using a modified version of the Wall Street Journal's
[Squaire library](https://wsj.github.io/squaire/) and MinnPost's [aRanger](http://code.minnpost.com/aranger/)
to produce the cartogram layout.
