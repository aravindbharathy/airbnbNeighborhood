Google Maps API v3 Meets Geoxml3

This project is a simple "Hello World" using multiple KML file sources to
show a map with a clickable sidebar and layer controls.  Two KML files are
used, one which contains only placemarks (and are shown in the sidebar),
and one which contains polygons.

A sidebar is created based on the placemarks defined in the first (zero
index) Geoxml3 document.  This sidebar uses jQuery to highlight the current
mouse position.  It also has click events to trigger a Google Maps marker
click.

The second (one index) document contains polygons, and that, like the
placemarks layer, have visibility controls in a footer map control area.
